# VISCOUS

VISCOUS, variance-based sensitivity analysis using copulas, is a data-driven sensitivity method that can use or reuse existing model evaluations (parameter sets and their response function) to estimate the sensitivity of the response to any parameters. VISCOUS is designed to be computationally efficient as it does not need a structured sampling of parameter space.
